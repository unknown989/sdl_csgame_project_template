Hi, so this repo is made according to my coding standards, so basically the old style of coding, no IDE, just vscode and a terminal. but ill try to write a thorough guide on how to set it up.

so first of all u need the compiler that i am using(not gcc but rather clang, gcc can work too but at a certain point i stopped testing it)
following this guide to download it: https://wetmelon.github.io/clang-on-windows.html

(if u are experienced and know how to use Make, go ahead and use it to compile if not keep reading)
U can then compile ur codebase using the file 'run.bat', u can double click it, or run it from the terminal, do as u see fits
