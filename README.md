# Welcome, Welcome

So, this repo is built following my personal coding quirks—think of it as the “old-school” style of coding, where no fancy IDEs are involved. Just **VSCode** and a  **terminal**. ill do my best to guide you through setting it up, don’t worry!

## Prerequisites

You’ll need **Clang++** (because who needs GCC, right?). Well, GCC *can* work, but I stopped testing it at some point.

Follow this guide to get Clang on your Windows system:

## Building the Project

### Option 1: Not Experienced with Makefiles
If you’re not into **Makefiles** or just want to keep it simple, just double-click the **run.bat** file and let it work its magic. Or you can run it from the terminal.

### Option 2: Experienced with Makefiles
You know what to do. hehe
