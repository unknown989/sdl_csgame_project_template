                                        If you have high number of iterations, constraints should converge to a better solution
                                        with the cost of more load on CPU. Lower number of iterations can result in poor

                             also impacts the performance greatly because the whole simulation is processed 
                             and collisions are recalculated by given amounts of times internally. In a game,

                                  The final damping value is calculated as
                                  `0.99 ^ (r * d)` where `d` is this value and
                                  `r` is damping ratio of a rigid body, usually 1.
                                  You can change damping ratios of individual bodies

                               allows to have greatly increased stability with little overhead.
                               Warmstarting is basically using the last simulation step's solutions
                               for constraints as the starting guess in the solver.
